This project is for implementing C in shell.



## Members
Damir Todic & Mirza Nikolic

## Listing of all files
damirza.c

## Outline of the Assignment
We've put together a basic implementation of all of the tasks that were assigned to us for this project, while attempting to implement each shell command as a separate function. We've been researching functions and commands that other people have used in their own operations throughout the project, and we've come up with conclusions and solutions to our own problems.

## Instructions for compiling
gcc damirza.c -o damirza   
./damirza

## Challenges
We've run into a few syntax issues as a result of the project's complexity. The majority of the problems were typographic in nature (forgeting ;, mispelling variables, etc.). We also had an issue with implicit function declaration, which we solved by declaring the function at the top of the file or adding appropriate imports. Another challenge for us was locating the best possible resources to enable us to carry out all of the tasks that were assigned to us, which we tried to accomplish.

## Sources
We used a variety of resources, the majority of which were just tutorials on YouTube and other websites. Because we are programmers, stackoverflow has always been a good friend of ours, containing many of our unanswered questions.
